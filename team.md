# BU CS MET673 Team1

### Sean Rawson
My name is Sean and I'm currently in my second to last class for the MSSD program at
BU MET. I've recently completed an internship as an integration engineer, and just started
my first full time position as a programmer/analyst at an insurance company. Most of my
academic and professional development experience has been with Java and Spring Boot. I also
have limited experience with Javascript, React, and Vue. Up until now, most of my projects
have been focused primarily on coding. I'm looking forward to growing my skills in other
critical aspects of the software engineering process through this course!
